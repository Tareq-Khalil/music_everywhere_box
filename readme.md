# Music Everywhere Box 

A portable, battery-powered smart music box that plays high-quality MP3 music and allows full track control via a rotary knob and OLED display.

## Why I Made This Project

I wanted to build something elegant and customizable that blends old-school music box vibes with modern smart controls. It had to sound great, look clean, and be completely wireless. A perfect companion for quiet mornings or creative work sessions.
